Hi, my name is Jianghui(Prounced as: Jyang-Hway)

I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Yang Yu](https://www.wolai.com/eyounx/dtR1MTyRXS5tP5Cex4KtdK).

<!-- add other reaserch experiment here-->

My research interests focus on the intersection of pretraining and vision-language modeling, with current themes including:

**Robustness Pretraining**: Developing models capable of generalizing across diverse and challenging environments.

**Video Understanding**: Enhancing comprehensive video understanding, with a particular focus on video streaming and long-format videos.


<!-- I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position to further pursue these research interests.-->
